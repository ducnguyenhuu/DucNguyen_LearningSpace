# Knowledge Base AI Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Production-Grade Architecture

All features MUST be designed and implemented to production
standards from day one. This means:

- Clean separation of concerns across well-defined layers
  (parsers, services, providers, API routes, UI components)
- Every module MUST have a single, clear responsibility
- No prototype-quality code in main branches; all merges
  MUST pass linting, type checking, and tests
- Error handling MUST be explicit — no silent failures;
  every error MUST be logged with context and surfaced
  appropriately to the caller
- Configuration MUST be externalized via environment
  variables with sensible defaults

**Rationale**: The application is designed for local use now
with a clear path to server deployment. Cutting corners on
architecture creates compounding technical debt that blocks
the deployment transition.

### II. REST API Contract Boundary

The backend MUST communicate with the frontend exclusively
through a versioned REST API (and WebSocket for real-time
features). This means:

- All backend functionality MUST be exposed through
  `/api/v1/` endpoints — no direct database access or
  shared state between frontend and backend
- API contracts MUST be documented before implementation
  and treated as the source of truth
- Breaking API changes MUST increment the API version
- Request/response schemas MUST be validated using Pydantic
  models on the backend and TypeScript interfaces on the
  frontend
- WebSocket channels are permitted only for real-time
  features (ingestion progress, LLM streaming)

**Rationale**: A strict API boundary enables independent
development, testing, and deployment of frontend and backend.
It also ensures the backend can serve other clients (CLI,
mobile) in the future without modification.

### III. Provider Abstraction (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All external model integrations (embedding and LLM) MUST be
abstracted behind provider interfaces. This means:

- An abstract base class MUST define the contract for each
  provider type (`EmbeddingProvider`, `LLMProvider`)
- Concrete implementations (local distilled, OpenAI, Claude)
  MUST implement the abstract interface without leaking
  implementation details
- Switching providers MUST require only a configuration
  change — zero modifications to services, routes, or
  business logic
- A factory pattern MUST resolve the correct provider
  instance from configuration at startup

**Rationale**: The project explicitly plans to migrate from
cost-efficient local distilled models to commercial APIs.
This principle ensures that migration is a configuration
change, not a refactoring effort.

### IV. Structured Observability

All application behavior MUST be observable through
structured logging. This means:

- All log entries MUST be structured JSON via `structlog`
- Every request MUST carry a correlation `request_id`
  propagated through all downstream log entries
- Log entries MUST include contextual fields: `job_id`,
  `document_id`, `conversation_id`, `file_name`,
  `duration_ms` as applicable
- Log levels MUST be used consistently: INFO for normal
  operations, WARNING for recoverable issues (skipped
  files, low disk), ERROR for failures requiring attention
- Logs MUST be written to stdout (for Docker/server) and
  optionally to rotating files (for local development)

**Rationale**: Troubleshooting a RAG pipeline (parse → chunk
→ embed → store → retrieve → generate) requires tracing a
request across multiple services. Structured logging with
correlation IDs is the minimum viable observability for
production diagnosis.

### V. Lightweight & User-Friendly UI

The frontend MUST prioritize usability, speed, and clarity
over visual complexity. This means:

- Pages MUST load and become interactive within 2 seconds
  on a standard consumer machine
- The UI MUST be responsive across desktop, tablet, and
  mobile breakpoints
- Navigation MUST be intuitive — a new user MUST be able
  to ingest documents and ask their first question without
  reading documentation
- Visual feedback MUST be provided for all long-running
  operations (progress bars, spinners, streaming tokens)
- The design MUST use a clean, minimal aesthetic — no
  unnecessary decorative elements or heavy component
  libraries

**Rationale**: The target user is a knowledge worker running
the app locally. They need fast, distraction-free access to
their documents and answers, not a feature-heavy dashboard.

### VI. Incremental Delivery

Every feature MUST be deliverable as independently testable
user story slices. This means:

- Each user story in the spec MUST be implementable,
  testable, and demonstrable without depending on
  unfinished stories
- The task list MUST be organized by user story, not by
  technical layer
- A working MVP MUST be achievable by completing only the
  P1 user story (document ingestion)
- Integration between stories MUST be additive — completing
  story N MUST NOT break stories 1 through N-1

**Rationale**: A single developer working locally benefits
most from seeing working software early and often. Incremental
delivery reduces risk and provides continuous validation that
the architecture works end-to-end.

## Additional Constraints

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.11+ with FastAPI — async-first,
  type-hinted, Pydantic-validated
- **Frontend**: TypeScript strict mode + React 18 with Vite
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite (local) /
  PostgreSQL (server) — switching MUST require only a
  connection string change
- **Vector Store**: ChromaDB in embedded mode
- **Models**: Ollama for LLM inference; sentence-transformers
  for embedding (with Ollama as fallback)
- **Logging**: structlog with JSON output

### Deployment

- Local development MUST work with `uvicorn --reload` (backend)
  and `npm run dev` (frontend) with no additional infrastructure
- Server deployment MUST be achievable via `docker-compose up`
  with PostgreSQL and Nginx
- All runtime data (SQLite DB, ChromaDB, model cache) MUST
  reside under a single `data/` directory that is gitignored

### Testing

- Backend: pytest with coverage reporting (`--cov=app`)
- Frontend: Vitest + React Testing Library
- Integration tests MUST verify the full RAG pipeline
  (ingest → query → answer)
- Unit tests MUST cover parsers, chunker, providers, and
  services independently

## Development Workflow

### Code Review & Quality Gates

1. All code MUST pass type checking (`mypy` for Python,
   `tsc --noEmit` for TypeScript) before merge
2. All code MUST pass linting (`ruff` for Python, `eslint`
   for TypeScript)
3. Test coverage MUST NOT decrease with new changes
4. API contract changes MUST be reflected in
   `contracts/api-contracts.md` before implementation

### Branching & Commits

- Feature branches follow the format `###-feature-name`
- Commits MUST be atomic and descriptive
- Each completed user story SHOULD be a merge-ready
  increment

### Specification Workflow

1. `/speckit.specify` → Feature specification (user stories,
   requirements, success criteria)
2. `/speckit.clarify` → Resolve ambiguities (up to 5
   targeted questions)
3. `/speckit.plan` → Implementation plan (research, data
   model, contracts, quickstart)
4. `/speckit.tasks` → Task breakdown by user story
5. `/speckit.implement` → Execute tasks

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices
for the Knowledge Base AI project. Amendments follow this
process:

1. **Proposal**: Document the change with rationale
2. **Impact Assessment**: Identify affected principles,
   templates, and existing code
3. **Versioning**: Apply semantic versioning — MAJOR for
   principle removals/redefinitions, MINOR for additions/
   expansions, PATCH for clarifications/typos
4. **Propagation**: Update all dependent templates and
   agent context files to reflect the change
5. **Compliance Review**: All active pull requests MUST be
   re-validated against updated principles

Complexity beyond what is prescribed MUST be justified in
the plan's Complexity Tracking table with a clear rationale
and an explanation of why the simpler alternative was
rejected.

Use `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for runtime
development guidance.
