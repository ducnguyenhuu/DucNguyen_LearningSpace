# Feature Specification: Multi-Agent AI Loan Underwriting System

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-loan-underwriting-system`  
**Created**: November 19, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Educational research project to learn AI agent orchestration, Gen AI reasoning, OCR, RAG, and MCP integration through building a loan underwriting system

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Document Processing & Extraction (Priority: P1)

A learner wants to understand how AI extracts structured data from unstructured loan application documents (pay stubs, bank statements, tax returns) using a hybrid OCR approach.

**Why this priority**: Foundation for all other agents - without document extraction, no downstream analysis is possible. This represents the entry point data pipeline and demonstrates cost-effective OCR strategies.

**Independent Test**: Upload a sample pay stub PDF, system extracts structured fields (employer name, gross/net income, pay period) as JSON with confidence scores, demonstrating Document Intelligence primary extraction and GPT-4 Vision fallback when confidence is low.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a clean digital pay stub PDF, **When** learner uploads it via notebook, **Then** Azure Document Intelligence extracts all required fields with >0.7 confidence and returns structured JSON matching Pydantic schema
2. **Given** a scanned/poor quality document, **When** Document Intelligence returns <0.7 confidence on critical fields, **Then** system automatically triggers GPT-4 Vision fallback and successfully extracts data
3. **Given** extracted data from either tool, **When** GPT-4 normalization runs, **Then** field names are unified and derived values (monthly from annual income) are calculated
4. **Given** normalized extraction results, **When** validation pass executes, **Then** system checks consistency rules (net <= gross income, dates chronological) and flags violations
5. **Given** completed extraction, **When** learner views output in notebook, **Then** see JSON with completeness score, confidence per field, and which tool was used (DI vs Vision)

---

### User Story 2 - Financial Risk Analysis (Priority: P1)

A learner wants to understand how AI agents calculate financial metrics (DTI, LTV, PTI) and perform risk assessment by combining structured rules with GPT-4 reasoning.

**Why this priority**: Core underwriting logic - demonstrates both deterministic calculation and AI-powered interpretation. Shows MCP data access pattern and how agents combine multiple data sources.

**Independent Test**: Given extracted document data and SSN, system queries mock credit database via MCP, calculates financial ratios, prompts GPT-4 for risk analysis, and returns risk level (low/medium/high) with reasoning.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** extracted income/debt data and an SSN, **When** risk agent executes, **Then** MCP server queries mock credit database and returns credit score, payment history, utilization
2. **Given** extracted data and credit info, **When** financial calculations run, **Then** system computes DTI = (monthly debt / monthly income) × 100, LTV = (loan amount / property value) × 100, PTI accurately
3. **Given** calculated metrics, **When** GPT-4 risk analysis prompt executes, **Then** LLM returns risk level with top 3 risk factors and top 3 mitigating factors
4. **Given** completed risk assessment, **When** learner views results in notebook, **Then** see interactive Plotly chart of DTI/LTV/PTI bars and GPT-4's step-by-step reasoning
5. **Given** multiple test profiles (excellent 820 score vs risky 620 score), **When** learner processes both, **Then** system produces different risk levels and reasoning reflecting credit quality differences

---

### User Story 3 - Policy Compliance via RAG (Priority: P2)

A learner wants to understand how Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves AI accuracy by retrieving relevant lending policies and using them as context for compliance checking.

**Why this priority**: Demonstrates semantic search and context augmentation - key technique for grounding LLM responses in specific organizational knowledge. Critical for understanding vector embeddings.

**Independent Test**: Given a compliance question ("Is DTI 38% acceptable?"), system embeds query, searches Azure AI Search for relevant policy chunks, retrieves top-k results, passes to GPT-4 with context, and returns grounded answer citing specific policy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** 5-10 lending policy documents, **When** offline indexing runs, **Then** system chunks documents, generates Ada-002 embeddings, and stores in Azure AI Search with metadata
2. **Given** indexed policies and a natural language query, **When** learner submits question in notebook, **Then** system embeds query using same model and performs cosine similarity search
3. **Given** search results, **When** top 3 chunks retrieved, **Then** system constructs context string and sends to GPT-4 with compliance checking prompt
4. **Given** GPT-4 response with context, **When** learner compares to response without RAG, **Then** context-augmented answer cites specific policy section and is more accurate
5. **Given** edge case query not in policies, **When** RAG search returns low similarity scores, **Then** system acknowledges lack of relevant policy and avoids hallucination

---

### User Story 4 - Final Decision & Explanation Generation (Priority: P2)

A learner wants to understand how AI makes transparent lending decisions by aggregating outputs from all previous agents and generating human-readable explanations.

**Why this priority**: Demonstrates multi-factor AI reasoning and explainability - critical for trustworthy AI systems. Shows how to combine rules-based logic with LLM judgment.

**Independent Test**: Given outputs from document, risk, and compliance agents, decision agent applies rules matrix, prompts GPT-4 for comprehensive analysis, calculates risk-adjusted interest rate, and returns decision (Approved/Rejected/Conditional) with detailed explanation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** complete agent outputs (extracted data, risk assessment, compliance report), **When** decision agent aggregates, **Then** system combines all factors into single state object
2. **Given** aggregated state, **When** decision rules execute, **Then** system applies thresholds (e.g., auto-reject if DTI >43% and credit <640) deterministically
3. **Given** borderline case not matching clear rules, **When** GPT-4 decision prompt executes, **Then** LLM provides recommendation balancing all factors with transparent reasoning
4. **Given** approved decision, **When** rate calculation runs, **Then** system computes risk-adjusted interest rate based on credit score and risk level
5. **Given** final decision, **When** explanation generation prompt executes, **Then** GPT-4 produces plain-language summary explaining key approval/rejection factors and any conditions

### User Story 5 - Multi-Agent Orchestration with LangGraph (Priority: P3)

A learner wants to understand how LangGraph coordinates sequential agent execution, manages state persistence across agents, and handles error scenarios in multi-agent workflows.

**Why this priority**: Advanced orchestration pattern - builds on all previous stories. Demonstrates production-ready workflow management but not strictly required for learning individual agent concepts.

**Independent Test**: Submit complete loan application, LangGraph executes document → risk → compliance → decision agents in sequence, persists state between transitions, handles agent failures gracefully, and returns final output with execution metadata.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a complete loan application (PDFs + applicant info), **When** orchestrator invokes workflow, **Then** LangGraph initializes ApplicationState and executes document agent first
2. **Given** document agent completes successfully, **When** state transition occurs, **Then** extracted_data populates ApplicationState and risk agent receives it as input
3. **Given** risk agent completes, **When** compliance agent executes, **Then** ApplicationState contains both extracted_data and risk_assessment for policy checking
4. **Given** document agent fails with OCR error, **When** error handler triggers, **Then** workflow transitions to Error state with descriptive message and does not execute downstream agents
5. **Given** complete workflow execution, **When** learner views orchestration notebook, **Then** see state evolution across agents, execution time per agent, and final decision with full audit trail

---

### User Story 6 - Experiment Tracking with MLflow (Priority: P3)

A learner wants to understand how to track ML experiments by logging agent execution metrics, comparing different prompts/models, and visualizing performance over multiple test cases.

**Why this priority**: Best practice for ML reproducibility - valuable but not critical for understanding core agent logic. Most useful after multiple experiments to compare variations.

**Independent Test**: Process 10+ diverse loan applications, MLflow logs execution time, token usage, costs per agent, approval rate, and prompt versions, then learner views dashboard comparing experiments.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** MLflow local server running, **When** orchestrator processes application, **Then** system logs start time, end time, parameters (model name, temperature), and metrics (tokens, cost) per agent
2. **Given** multiple applications processed, **When** learner opens MLflow UI, **Then** see run history with approval rate, average processing time, and cost per application
3. **Given** two different risk analysis prompts, **When** learner runs same test cases with both, **Then** MLflow tracks as separate experiments and enables side-by-side comparison
4. **Given** logged artifacts, **When** learner inspects specific run, **Then** see saved outputs (extracted JSONs, risk assessments, decisions) for reproducibility
5. **Given** 20+ applications across multiple experiments, **When** learner queries MLflow, **Then** can filter by parameters (e.g., all runs with GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5) and compare performance metrics

---

### User Story 7 - Cost Optimization & Fallback Strategy (Priority: P3)

A learner wants to understand cost/performance tradeoffs by observing when the system uses cheap Document Intelligence vs expensive GPT-4 Vision, and logging fallback decisions.

**Why this priority**: Real-world production concern - demonstrates practical AI engineering beyond pure functionality. Teaches budget-conscious development.

**Independent Test**: Process mix of clean and poor-quality documents, system attempts Document Intelligence first, logs confidence scores, triggers Vision fallback only when needed, and reports cost breakdown showing 10x savings.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a batch of 10 clean digital PDFs, **When** document agent processes, **Then** 9/10 use Document Intelligence only (~$0.001/page) without Vision fallback
2. **Given** a scanned low-quality PDF, **When** Document Intelligence returns 0.5 confidence, **Then** system logs fallback trigger reason and invokes GPT-4 Vision (~$0.02/image)
3. **Given** both DI and Vision produce results for same field, **When** values conflict, **Then** GPT-4 text adjudication prompt receives both and picks correct value with reasoning
4. **Given** completed batch processing, **When** learner views cost analysis, **Then** see per-document cost breakdown and total showing DI-first strategy saves ~80-90% vs Vision-only approach
5. **Given** logged fallback cases, **When** learner analyzes patterns, **Then** identify document types consistently needing Vision (e.g., handwritten notes) as candidates for custom model training

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when** uploaded PDF is corrupted or unreadable by all OCR tools?
  - System logs error, marks document as "manual_review_required", does not block other documents in batch, and continues workflow with partial data flagged
  
- **What happens when** MCP server is unreachable during credit lookup?
  - Risk agent retries 3 times with exponential backoff, if still failing returns risk assessment with "credit_score: null" and higher risk level due to missing data, logs connectivity issue

- **What happens when** Azure AI Search returns zero relevant policy results for compliance query?
  - Compliance agent acknowledges no applicable policy found, prompts GPT-4 to state "insufficient policy guidance" rather than hallucinate, marks application as "pending_manual_review"

- **What happens when** two agents return contradictory information (e.g., extracted income differs between document types)?
  - Decision agent flags discrepancy in explanation, prompts GPT-4 to highlight inconsistency, recommends "conditional_approval pending income verification"

- **What happens when** learner runs notebook without Azure credentials configured?
  - Setup validation cell fails immediately with clear error message pointing to .env.example, prevents cryptic API errors downstream

- **What happens when** GPT-4 returns malformed JSON instead of expected Pydantic schema?
  - Validation layer catches Pydantic parsing error, logs raw response, retries with explicit schema instruction in prompt (max 3 retries), then fails gracefully with error message

- **How does system handle** extremely high loan amounts exceeding typical policy ranges?
  - Compliance agent retrieves policies, GPT-4 identifies amount as outlier, decision agent automatically flags as "requires_senior_review" regardless of other factors

- **How does system handle** missing critical document types (e.g., no pay stub uploaded)?
  - Document agent returns extraction result with completeness score <0.5, downstream agents receive partial data, decision agent returns "pending_additional_documents" status listing missing items
